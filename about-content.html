        Hi there! I'm a 22 year old living in Orlando, Florida. Currently, I'm employed at Walt Disney World in the Entertainment department, spending most of my days in different parades and shows at all 4 theme parks. I also work at Give Kids the World Village, a non-profit that works alongside wish-granting foundations like the Make-A-Wish Foundation to accomodate critically ill children on their wish-trips in central Florida, as an Entertainment Coordinator!

        In my freetime, I enjoy self-betterment activities like reading, working out, etc. I also love food and, of course, theme parks. Recently, I've taken an interest in coding, and am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through the University of Central Florida. This webpage is a showcase of my work!
